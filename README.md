# StressPredictionModels
This project evaluates the cross-dataset generalisability of machine learning algorithms trained on smartwatch data for stress prediction. Models are trained on the WESAD dataset and tested on the AffectiveROAD dataset, with a focus on investigating the role of domain adaptation techniques in improving generalisation.
